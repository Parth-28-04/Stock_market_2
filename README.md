Project Overview:
Analyzed historical stock market data to identify trends, patterns, and forecast future stock prices. The project involved data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model building using Python.

Key Responsibilities:

Data Collection & Cleaning: Loaded and preprocessed historical stock data, handled missing values, and converted date formats for consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized stock price trends, trading volume, and feature correlations using Matplotlib and Seaborn. Analyzed daily returns and moving averages.
Feature Engineering: Created new features such as daily returns and moving averages (10-day and 50-day) to aid in predictive modeling.
Predictive Modeling (Optional): Implemented a predictive model using Linear Regression to forecast future stock prices, evaluating performance through metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Documentation & Reporting: Documented the analysis process and results, including visualizations and insights into stock price behavior.
Tools & Technologies:

Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Data Handling: CSV file operations
Visualization: Time series plots, correlation matrix, histograms
